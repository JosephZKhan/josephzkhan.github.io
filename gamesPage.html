													I was lucky enough to work with <a href="https://www.groundshatter.com/">Ground Shatter</a> for 2 years on Knights In Tight Spaces, the follow-up to BAFTA-nominated roguelike deckbuilder Fights In Tight Spaces. I was the most junior of a programming team of 3, in an overall team of 15. 
													<br> <br>
													I lead the implementation of the procedurally generated world map using Voronoi cells, and has a large hand in adapting and expanding the gameplay framework to allow support new actions for the many abilities and status effects in the turn-based combat. 
													<br> <br>
													Another notable ongoing task was setting up the definition assets for game elements, including abilities, cards, levels and quests. This involved extensive usage of Unity's editor scripting capabilities to lay out class properties in an intuitive way for designers to make adjustments.
													<br> <br>
													I also set up several of the game's UI screens, giving functionality to designs provided by others, and in the process became familiar with handling both mouse/keyboard and gamepad input for menus of varying layouts. 
													<br> <br>
													This internship was an unforgettable experience with a wonderful team of talent, which I credit with pulling back much of the curtain of mystique surrounding the nature of professional games development.
													<br> <br>
													The project was made in Unity, with <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/">Inkle</a> for narrative scripting. Plastic SCM was used for source control. Slack and Clickup were used as management software.

												<p>
													I have spent the past year working on Enfrosted, a group project for my final year of university. I took on the roles of Lead Design, Programming, Writing and Management in a team of 9 people.
													<br><br>
													A version of the game is due for completion by May as the assessment comes to an end, but the team plans to continue development for an eventual PC release on Steam later this year.
													<br><br>
													It was made in Unreal Engine 5, using FMOD for additional audio operations. Git was used for source control. Trello, Github Wiki and Google Sheets were used as management software.
